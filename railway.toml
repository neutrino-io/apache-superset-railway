# ============================================================================
# Optional: Redis Configuration for Production
# ============================================================================
# Redis is recommended for production deployments to enable:
# - Distributed rate limiting (Flask-Limiter)
# - Distributed caching
# - Session storage across multiple instances
#
# To enable Redis support:
# 1. Deploy a Redis service on Railway
# 2. Add the Redis connection URL as an environment variable:
#
# REDIS_URL = "redis://:password@redis-host:6379/0"
#
# If REDIS_URL is not set, Superset will fall back to in-memory storage
# which works for single-instance deployments but has limitations:
# - Rate limiting state is not shared across instances
# - Cache is not shared across instances
# - Sessions are not persistent across restarts
#
# Example Redis deployment on Railway:
# 1. Create new Redis service in Railway
# 2. Copy the connection URL from Railway's Redis service
# 3. Set REDIS_URL environment variable in this service
